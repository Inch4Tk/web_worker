# Web Worker

Rayon-like worker thread pool. Heavily inspired and based on the works of [Alex Crichton](https://github.com/alexcrichton)  (I only adapted his code to be reusable outside of the wasm-bindgen crate.)

[Original example](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/master/examples/raytrace-parallel)
